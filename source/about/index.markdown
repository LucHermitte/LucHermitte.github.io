Hello all,

I'm a French C++ developer in Aerospace industry. As such, this blog will be
about C++. However, most of my C++ posts will be in French (sorry guys).

I've also been a vimmer for quite some times now.  [Vim](http://www.vim.org)
posts should be in English. And they'll be about my plugins suites hosted
<del>partially on [google-code](https://code.google.com/p/lh-vim/), and</del> on
[github](https://github.com/LucHermitte/).

If you want to contact me, if it's related my plugins, try the trackers from
github. I welcome enhancement/feature suggestions, bugs and misspelling
notifications, _etc._

You can also send an email to
[lh-vim-users](http://groups.google.com/group/lh-vim-users) group, or directly
send me an email to hermitte{at}free{dot}fr.  
However, sometimes my email server has an odd behaviour, and all my outgoing
emails are likely to be filtered out by spamcops-like bots. Send me an email
to luc{dot}hermitte{at}gmail{dot}com, if you suspect your email was lost
somewhere -- I consult my gmail mailbox something like twice a month ^^'

Last thing, as French law doesn't let me put all my code snippets under Public
Domain, let's say that they are available under BSD 3 clauses license, and under
MIT license, and under Boost Software License, and under GPL v3 license, and
even under CC 0. Choose the one that fits you best.
