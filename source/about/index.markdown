Hello all,

I'm a French C++ developer in Aerospace industry. As such, this blog will be
about C++. However, most of my C++ posts will be in French (sorry guys).

I've also been a vimmer for quite some times now.  [Vim](http://www.vim.org)
posts should be in English. And they'll be about my plugins suites hosted
partially on [google-code](https://code.google.com/p/lh-vim/), and on
[github](https://github.com/LucHermitte/).

If you want to contact me, if it's related my plugins, try the trackers from
google-code or from github depending on where the plugin is hosted.
Otherwise, you can also follow the contact information I've given on
[lh-vim contact page](https://code.google.com/p/lh-vim/wiki/contact).


Last thing, as French law doesn't let me put all my code snippets under Public
Domain, let's say that they are available under BSD 3 clauses license, and under
MIT license, and under Boost Software License, and under GPL v3 license, and
even under CC 0. Choose the one that fits you best.
