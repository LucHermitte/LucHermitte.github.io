The blog engine is [Octopress](http://octopress.org). It has been tuned to:

- support dynamic table of contents (see https://github.com/bmc blog) ;
- ease the generation of the final pages (see
  http://www.ewal.net/2012/09/08/octopress-customizations/);
- have an about page, and an _about aside_
- save empty lines before bullet lists
